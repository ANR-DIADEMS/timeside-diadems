TimeSide : open web audio processing framework
==============================================

    :target: http://travis-ci.org/yomguy/TimeSide/

TimeSide is a set of python components enabling audio analysis, imaging, transcoding and streaming. Its high-level API has been designed to enable complex processing on big media data corpus. Its simple plugin architecture can be adapted to various usecases.

It also includes a smart HTML5 interactive user interface embeddable in any web application to provide various media format playback, on the fly transcoding and streaming, fancy waveforms and spectrograms, various low and high level audio analyzers, semantic labelling and segmentation.


Goals
=====

We just **need** a python library to:

* **Do** asynchronous and fast audio processing with Python,
* **Decode** audio frames from ANY format into numpy arrays,
* **Analyze** audio content with some state-of-the-art audio feature extraction libraries,
* **Organize**, serialize and save analysis metadata through various formats,
* **Draw** various fancy waveforms, spectrograms and other cool graphers,
* **Transcode** audio data in various media formats and stream them through web apps,
* **Playback** and **interact** **on demand** through a smart high-level HTML5 extensible player,
* **Index**, **tag** and **organize semantic metadata** (see `Telemeta <http://telemeta.org>`_ which embed TimeSide).

Here is a schematic diagram of the TimeSide engine architecture:

Available plugins
=================

* Decoder:
     - Takes ALL known media formats thanks to GStreamer

* Analyzers:
     - Levels : max level, mean level, DC
     - Yaafe : all data flows
     - Aubio : BPM, beats, pitch, various spectral descriptors
     - VAMP : all default plugins from simple host
     - IRIT : 4Hz modulation and entropy speech detectors

* Graphers:
     - Waveform
     - Contour
     - Spectrogram

* Encoders:
     - WAV
     - FLAC
     - WebM
     - OGG Vorbis
     - MP3

* Serializers:
     - YAML
     - JSON
     - XML
     - HDF5

 * add support for Pillow (closes: #12)
 * temporally desactivate AAC and WebM encoders (need to add some limits for them)
 * WARNING : we now need to add overwrite=True to encoder kwargs instances in order to overwrite the destination file, i.e. e=Mp3Encoder(path, overwrite=True)

0.4.2

 * many releases these days, but there are some patches which are really worth to be HOT released : we just need them in production..
 * finally fix FFT window border leaks in the streaming spectrum process for *really* better spectrograms and *smoother* spectral centroid waveforms
 * *mv* gstutils to timeside.gstutils
 * cleanup various processes
 * Ogg, Aac and Flac encoders not really working now (some frames missing) :( Will be fixed in next release.

0.4.1

 * move UI static files from ui/ to static/timeside/ (for better django compatibility)
 * upgrade js scripts from telemeta 1.4.4
 * upgrade SoundManager2 to v297a-20120916

0.4.0

 * finally fixed an old decoder bug to prevent memory leaks during hard process (thanks to piem)
 * add blocksize property to the processor API
 * add many unit tests (check tests/alltests.py)
 * re-add UI files (sorry, was missing in the last packages)
 * various bugfixes
 * encoders not all much tested on big files, please test!
 * piem is now preparing some aubio analyzers :P

0.3.3

 * but add "ts-waveforms" script for waveform batching
 * fix some tests
 * removed but download audio samples
 * fix setup
 * update README

0.3.2

 * move mainloop to its own thread to avoid memory hogging on large files
 * add condition values to prepare running gst mainloop in a thread
 * add experimental WebM encoder
 * duration analysis goes to decoder.duration property

Dive in
========

Define some processors::

 >>> import timeside
 >>> decoder  =  timeside.decoder.FileDecoder('sweep.wav')
 >>> grapher  =  timeside.grapher.Waveform()
 >>> analyzer =  timeside.analyzer.Level()
 >>> encoder  =  timeside.encoder.VorbisEncoder('sweep.ogg')

then, the *magic* pipeline::

 >>> (decoder | grapher | analyzer | encoder).run()

get the results::

 >>> grapher.render(output='waveform.png')
 >>> print 'Level:', analyzer.results


Install
=======

TimeSide needs some other python modules to run. The following methods explain how to install all dependencies on various Linux based systems.

On Debian, Ubuntu, etc:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ echo "deb http://debian.parisson.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install python-timeside

On Fedora and Red-Hat:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ sudo yum install gcc python python-devel gstreamer pygobject2 \
                   gstreamer-python gstreamer gstreamer-plugins-bad-free \
                   gstreamer-plugins-bad-free-extras \
                   gstreamer-plugins-base gstreamer-plugins-good

 $ sudo pip install timeside

On other system, you'll need to install all dependencies and then::

 $ sudo pip install timeside


Dependencies
============

python (>=2.7), python-setuptools, python-gst0.10, gstreamer0.10-plugins-good, gstreamer0.10-gnonlin,
gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly, python-aubio, python-yaafe, python-simplejson, python-yaml, python-h5py,
python-scipy


Platforms
==========

The TimeSide engine is intended to work on all Unix / Linux platforms.
MacOS X and Windows versions will soon be explorated.
The player should work on any modern HTML5 enabled browser.
Flash is needed for MP3 if the browser doesn't support it.

Extensible HTML5 User Interface
================================

TimeSide comes with a smart HTML5 audio player which can drive the process engine through a web server.

Some examples of application:
