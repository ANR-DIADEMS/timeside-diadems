TimeSide : open and fast web audio components
==============================================

TimeSide is a set of python components enabling easy audio processing, transcoding, imaging and streaming. Its simple architecture and high-level API have been design to process serial pipelines.

It includes a powerfull HTM5 interactive player which can be embedded in any web application to provide fancy waveforms, various analyzer results, synced time metadata display during playback (time-marking) and remote indexing.

The engine (server side) is fully written in Python, the player (client side) in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Goals
=====

We just *need* a python library to:

 * build a python framework to do asynchronous audio processing,
 * decode audio frames from ANY format to numpy arrays,
 * stream the frames in processors and do numpy data analyzing,
 * create various waveforms, spectrograms, etc.. with numpy and PIL,
 * transcode the processed frames in various media formats and stream it,
 * provide a high-level HTML5 UI to stream the results *on demand* through the web,
 * remote metadata indexing and time marking (JSON RPC, needs a server system like `Telemeta <http://telemeta.org>`_).

Here is a schematic diagram of the TimeSide engine architecture:

News
=====

0.4.4

 * Only setup bugfixes

0.4.3

 * finally fix decoder leaks and de-synchronizations (thanks to piem)
 * this also fixes bad variable encoder file lengths
 * fix OGG and FLAC encoders (closes: #8)
 * fix multi-channels streaming (closes: #13)
 * add support for Pillow (closes: #12)
 * temporally desactivate AAC and WebM encoders (need to add some limits for them)
 * WARNING : we now need to add overwrite=True to encoder kwargs instances in order to overwrite the destination file, i.e. e=Mp3Encoder(path, overwrite=True)

0.4.2

 * many releases these days, but there are some patches which are really worth to be HOT released : we just need them in production..
 * finally fix FFT window border leaks in the streaming spectrum process for *really* better spectrograms and *smoother* spectral centroid waveforms
 * *mv* gstutils to timeside.gstutils
 * cleanup various processes
 * Ogg, Aac and Flac encoders not really working now (some frames missing) :( Will be fixed in next release.

0.4.1

 * move UI static files from ui/ to static/timeside/ (for better django compatibility)
 * upgrade js scripts from telemeta 1.4.4
 * upgrade SoundManager2 to v297a-20120916

0.4.0

 * finally fixed an old decoder bug to prevent memory leaks during hard process (thanks to piem)
 * add blocksize property to the processor API
 * add many unit tests (check tests/alltests.py)
 * re-add UI files (sorry, was missing in the last packages)
 * various bugfixes
 * encoders not all much tested on big files, please test!
 * piem is now preparing some aubio analyzers :P

0.3.3

 * mostly a transitional developer and mantainer version, no new cool features
 * but add "ts-waveforms" script for waveform batching
 * fix some tests
 * removed but download audio samples
 * fix setup
 * update README

0.3.2

 * move mainloop to its own thread to avoid memory hogging on large files
 * add condition values to prepare running gst mainloop in a thread
 * add experimental WebM encoder
 * duration analysis goes to decoder.duration property
 * bugfixes


Dive in
========

Define some processors::

 >>> import timeside
 >>> decoder  =  timeside.decoder.FileDecoder('source.wav')
 >>> grapher  =  timeside.grapher.Waveform()
 >>> analyzer =  timeside.analyzer.MaxLevel()
 >>> encoder  =  timeside.encoder.Mp3Encoder('output.mp3')

then, the *magic* pipeline::

 >>> (decoder | grapher | analyzer | encoder).run()

get the results::

 >>> grapher.render(output='image.png')
 >>> print 'Level:', analyzer.result()

and finally see image.png and play output.mp3 ;)

Related projects
=================

TimeSide has emerged in 2010 from the `Telemeta project <http://telemeta.org>`_ which develops a free and open-source web audio CMS.

Some decoders and encoders depend on the great `GStreamer framework <http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/>`_.


Platforms
=========

The TimeSide engine is intended to work on all Unix / Linux platforms, but MacOS X and Windows versions will soon be explorated.

The player should work on any modern HTML5 enabled browser. Flash is needed for MP3 if the browser doesn't support it.


Install
=======

TimeSide needs some other python modules to run. The following methods explain how to install all dependencies on a Debian based system like Debian, Ubuntu, etc.. On Fedora and Red-Hat you might replace 'apt-get by 'yum', on Gentoo by 'emerge', or any other package manager you like::

 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install python python-pip python-setuptools python-gobject \
                        python-gst0.10 gstreamer0.10-plugins-base gir1.0-gstreamer-0.10 \
                        gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad \
                        gobject-introspection

 $ sudo pip install timeside

To get non-free (MP3, MP4, AAC, etc) decoding and encoding features, add Debian Multimedia repository and install the modules::

 $ echo "deb http://www.deb-multimedia.org stable main non-free" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ apt-get install gstreamer0.10-lame gstreamer0.10-plugins-really-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly


Batching
=========

TimeSide provides *ts-waveforms*, a waveform rendering batch script. Usage::

 $ ts-waveforms /path/to/media_dir /path/to/img_dir

Please use absolute paths. For example::

 $ ts-waveforms /home/$user/music/mp3/ /home/$USER/images/

To change the color scheme or the size of the waveforms, edit the script from the source and change the variables of the GrapherScheme object::

 $ git clone git://github.com/yomguy/TimeSide.git
 $ cd timeside/scripts/
 $ vi ts-waveforms
 $ ./ts-waveforms /home/$user/music/mp3/ /home/$USER/images/


Packages included
=================

 * SoundManager 2 >= 2.91 (http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2)
 * jQuery => 1.2.6 (http://www.jquery.com)
 * jsGraphics => 3.03 (http://www.walterzorn.com/jsgraphics/jsgraphics_e.htm)
