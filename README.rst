==============================================
TimeSide : open web audio processing framework
==============================================

TimeSide is a set of python components enabling low and high level audio analysis, imaging, transcoding and streaming. Its high-level API is designed to enable complex processing on large datasets of audio and video assets of any format. Its simple plug-in  architecture can be adapted to various use cases.

TimeSide also includes a smart interactive HTML5 player which provides various streaming playback functions, formats selectors, fancy audio visualizations, segmentation and semantic labelling synchronized with audio events. It is embeddable in any web application.

Goals
======

* **Do** asynchronous and fast audio processing with Python,
* **Decode** audio frames from **any** audio or video media format into numpy arrays,
* **Analyze** audio content with some state-of-the-art audio feature extraction libraries,
* **Organize**, serialize and save analysis metadata through various formats,
* **Draw** various fancy waveforms, spectrograms and other cool visualizers,
* **Transcode** audio data in various media formats and stream them through web apps,
* **Playback** and **interact** **on demand** through a smart high-level HTML5 extensible player,
* **Index**, **tag** and **organize semantic metadata** (see `Telemeta <http://telemeta.org>`_ which embed TimeSide).


Architecture
============

The streaming architecture of TimeSide relies on 2 main parts: a processing engine including various plugin processors written in pure Python and a user interface providing some web based visualization and playback tools in pure HTML5.

Dive in
========

Define some processors::

 >>> import timeside
 >>> decoder  =  timeside.decoder.FileDecoder('sweep.wav')
 >>> grapher  =  timeside.grapher.Waveform()
 >>> analyzer =  timeside.analyzer.Level()
 >>> encoder  =  timeside.encoder.VorbisEncoder('sweep.ogg')

then, the *magic* pipeline::

 >>> (decoder | grapher | analyzer | encoder).run()

get the results::

 >>> grapher.render(output='waveform.png')
 >>> print 'Level:', analyzer.results

Install
=======

The TimeSide engine is intended to work on all Unix / Linux platforms.
MacOS X and Windows versions will soon be explorated.

TimeSide needs some other python modules to run. The following methods explain how to install all dependencies on various Linux based systems.

On Debian, Ubuntu, etc:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ echo "deb http://debian.parisson.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install python-timeside

On Fedora and Red-Hat:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ sudo yum install gcc python python-devel gstreamer pygobject2 \
                   gstreamer-python gstreamer gstreamer-plugins-bad-free \
                   gstreamer-plugins-bad-free-extras \
                   gstreamer-plugins-base gstreamer-plugins-good

 $ sudo pip install timeside

On other Linux platforms, you can also install all dependencies and then use pip::

 $ sudo pip install timeside

Dependencies
============

Note that TimeSide >=0.5 needs Python >=2.7 and is incompatible with previous versions of Python.

python (>=2.7), python-setuptools, python-gst0.10, gstreamer0.10-plugins-good, gstreamer0.10-gnonlin,
gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly, python-aubio, python-yaafe, python-simplejson, python-yaml, python-h5py,
python-scipy, python-matplotlib, python-matplotlib


Shell Interface
================

Of course, TimeSide can be used in any python environment. But, a shell script is also provided to enable preset based and recursive processing through your command line interface::

 $ timeside-launch -h
 Usage: scripts/timeside-launch [options] -c file.conf file1.wav [file2.wav ...]
  help: scripts/timeside-launch -h

 Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

                        list of graph output formats for the analyzers results
  -o <outputdir>, --ouput-directory=<outputdir>
                        output directory

Web Interface (the player)
==========================

TimeSide comes with a smart and pure **HTML5** audio player.

Features:
    * embed it in any audio web application
    * stream, playback and download various audio formats on the fly
    * synchronize sound with text, bitmap and vectorial events
    * seek through various semantic, analytic and time synced data
    * fully skinnable with CSS style

Screenshot:
 .. image:: https://raw.github.com/yomguy/TimeSide/master/doc/slides/img/timeside_player_01.png

Examples of the player embeded in the Telemeta open web audio CMS:
    * http://parisson.telemeta.org/archives/items/PRS_07_01_03/
    * http://archives.crem-cnrs.fr/items/CNRSMH_I_1956_002_001_01/

Development documentation:
    * https://github.com/yomguy/TimeSide/wiki/Ui-Guide

TODO list:
    * embed a light http server to get commands through something like JSON RPC
    * zoom
    * layers

The player should work on any modern HTML5 enabled browser.
Flash is needed for MP3 if the browser doesn't support it.

Development
===========

For versions >=0.5 on Debian Stable 7.0 Wheezy:
