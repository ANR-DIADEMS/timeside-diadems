==============================================
TimeSide : open web audio processing framework
==============================================

TimeSide is a set of python components enabling low and high level audio analysis, imaging, transcoding and streaming. Its high-level API is designed to enable complex processing on large datasets of audio and video assets of any format. Its simple plug-in architecture can be adapted to various use cases.

TimeSide also includes a smart interactive HTML5 player which provides various streaming playback functions, formats selectors, fancy audio visualizations, segmentation and semantic labelling synchronized with audio events. It is embeddable in any web application.

Goals
======

* **Do** asynchronous and fast audio processing with Python,
* **Decode** audio frames from **any** audio or video media format into numpy arrays,
* **Analyze** audio content with some state-of-the-art audio feature extraction libraries,
* **Organize**, serialize and save analysis metadata through various formats,
* **Draw** various fancy waveforms, spectrograms and other cool visualizers,
* **Transcode** audio data in various media formats and stream them through web apps,
* **Playback** and **interact** **on demand** through a smart high-level HTML5 extensible player,
* **Index**, **tag** and **organize semantic metadata** (see `Telemeta <http://telemeta.org>`_ which embed TimeSide).


Architecture
============

The streaming architecture of TimeSide relies on 2 main parts: a processing engine including various plugin processors written in pure Python and a user interface providing some web based visualization and playback tools in pure HTML5.

Dive in
========

To list all available plugins::

 >>> import timeside
 >>> timeside.core.list_processors()

Define some processors::

 >>> from timeside.core import get_processor
 >>> decoder  =  get_processor('gst_dec')('sweep.wav')
 >>> grapher  =  get_processor('waveform_simple')
 >>> analyzer =  get_processor('level')
 >>> encoder  =  get_processor('gst_vorbis_enc')('sweep.ogg')

Then run the *magic* pipeline::

 >>> (decoder | grapher | analyzer | encoder).run()

Render the grapher results::

 >>> grapher.render(output='waveform.png')

Show the analyzer results::

 >>> print 'Level:', analyzer.results

The encoded OGG file should also be there...

Note you can also instanciate each processor with its own class::
 
 >>> decoder  =  timeside.decoder.file.FileDecoder('sweep.wav')
 >>> grapher  =  timeside.grapher.waveform_simple.Waveform()
 >>> analyzer =  timeside.analyzer.level.Level()
 >>> encoder  =  timeside.encoder.ogg.VorbisEncoder('sweep.ogg')

Install
=======

The TimeSide engine is intended to work on all Linux and Unix like platforms.

It depends on several other python modules and compiled librairies like GStreamer. 

Debian, Ubuntu
---------------

For Debian based distributions, we provide a safe repository which provides all additional dependencies that are not included in Debian yet:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ echo "deb http://debian.parisson.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install python-timeside

This method is known to be compatible with Debian 7 Wheezy and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. It will install additional binary packages from several audio feature extraction librairies like Aubio and Yaafe for which TimeSide has some nice processors.

Note you can also use pip if you already have already satisfied all the dependencies::

 $ sudo pip install timeside

Other Linux distributions
--------------------------

On other Linux platforms, you need to install all dependencies listed at the paragraph `dependencies <#Dependencies>`_ (find all equivalent package names for your distribution). 

Then, use pip::
 
 $ sudo pip install timeside

OSX
---

The installation on OSX platforms is pretty hard at the moment because all dependencies are not in brew. But, it will be fully documented in the next release 0.5.6.

Dependencies
-------------

Needed::

 python python-setuptools python-numpy python-scipy python-h5py python-matplotlib pillow 
 python-simplejson python-yaml libhdf5-serial-dev python-gst0.10 gstreamer0.10-gnonlin 
 gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly 

Optional::

 aubio yaafe python-aubio python-yaafe vamp-examples
 django django-south djangorestframework django-extensions
User Interfaces
===============

Shell
------

Of course, TimeSide can be used in any python environment. But, a shell script is also provided to enable preset based and recursive processing through your command line interface::

 $ timeside-launch -h
 Usage: scripts/timeside-launch [options] -c file.conf file1.wav [file2.wav ...]
  help: scripts/timeside-launch -h

 Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         be verbose
  -q, --quiet           be quiet
  -C <config_file>, --conf=<config_file>
                        configuration file
  -s <samplerate>, --samplerate=<samplerate>
                        samplerate at which to run the pipeline
  -c <channels>, --channels=<channels>
                        number of channels to run the pipeline with
  -b <blocksize>, --blocksize=<blocksize>
                        blocksize at which to run the pipeline
  -a <analyzers>, --analyzers=<analyzers>
                        analyzers in the pipeline
  -g <graphers>, --graphers=<graphers>
                        graphers in the pipeline
  -e <encoders>, --encoders=<encoders>
                        encoders in the pipeline
  -R <formats>, --results-formats=<formats>
                        list of results output formats for the analyzers
                        results
  -I <formats>, --images-formats=<formats>
                        list of graph output formats for the analyzers results
  -o <outputdir>, --ouput-directory=<outputdir>
                        output directory

Web player
-----------

TimeSide comes with a smart and pure **HTML5** audio player.

Features:
    * embed it in any audio web application
    * stream, playback and download various audio formats on the fly
    * synchronize sound with text, bitmap and vectorial events
    * seek through various semantic, analytic and time synced data
    * fully skinnable with CSS style

Screenshot:
 .. image:: https://raw.github.com/yomguy/TimeSide/master/doc/slides/img/timeside_player_01.png

Examples of the player embeded in the Telemeta open web audio CMS:
    * http://parisson.telemeta.org/archives/items/PRS_07_01_03/
    * http://archives.crem-cnrs.fr/items/CNRSMH_I_1956_002_001_01/

Development documentation:
    * https://github.com/yomguy/TimeSide/wiki/Ui-Guide

TODO list:
    * zoom
    * layers


Web server
-----------

An EXPERIMENTAL web server based on Django has been added to the package from version 0.5.4. The goal is to provide a full REST API to TimeSide to enable new kinds of audio processing web services.

A sandbox is provide in timeside/server/sandbox and you can initialize it and test it like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd timeside/server/sandbox
  $ ./manage.py syncdb
  $ ./manage.py migrate
  $ ./manage.py runserver

and browse http://localhost:8000/api/

At the moment, this server is NOT connected to the player using TimeSide alone. Please use Telemeta.


Development
===========

For versions >=0.5 on Debian 7 Wheezy:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ echo "deb http://debian.parisson.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
 $ echo "deb-src http://debian.parisson.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install git
 $ sudo apt-get build-dep python-timeside

 $ git clone https://github.com/yomguy/TimeSide.git
 $ cd TimeSide
